/**
 * The configurations slot, and why the card is a fixed height.
 *
 * Cards in the recommendation grid must all be the same height, so the
 * configurations slot is a fixed-size box. It was capped at 56px with
 * overflow-hidden, which fits exactly two rows and nothing else — so on any
 * project with three or more configurations the "+X more configurations
 * available" line rendered and was then clipped by the very container meant to
 * keep the cards tidy. The buyer learned there were more configurations only if
 * they noticed a sliver of cut-off text.
 *
 * These are source assertions rather than render assertions on purpose: the
 * behaviour being protected is a layout constraint expressed in classes, and a
 * jsdom render reports every height as zero.
