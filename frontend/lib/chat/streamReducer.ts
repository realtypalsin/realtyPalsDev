 * component: seven `setChatHistory(prev => prev.map(...))` calls, each
 * reshaping the same message, none of them reachable from a test. The shaping
 * is pure — an event and a message in, a message out — so it does not need to
 * live next to the state that holds it.
 *
 * Side effects deliberately stay with the caller. Scrolling to a card, firing
 * analytics, PATCHing a session title and setting the rate-limit banner are not
 * message shape, and folding them in here would trade one untestable lump for
 * another. What is left is the part that was silently wrong most often.
