## Phase 0.3: Measure Actual Provider Usage

**Why:** Verify Gemini is actually being invoked (not silently falling back to expensive Groq).

### Step 1: Run SQL Query on Production Database

SSH to production database or use Supabase dashboard SQL editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  provider,
  COUNT(*) as call_count,
  SUM(prompt_tokens) as total_input_tokens,
  SUM(completion_tokens) as total_output_tokens,
  ROUND(SUM(cost_usd)::numeric, 2) as total_cost_usd,
  ROUND(AVG(cost_usd)::numeric, 4) as avg_cost_per_call
FROM ai_usage_event
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY provider
ORDER BY call_count DESC;
```

### Step 2: Interpret Results

Expected (post-optimization):
- **Provider distribution:** Gemini >60%, Groq 20-30%, fallback <10%
- **Cost trend:** Input tokens dominate (~90%), but compression + minification should reduce absolute cost
- **Gemini latency:** <1.5s p95 (early SSE status event masks the wait)

If Groq dominates (>50%):
- Gemini API key missing or Groq forced in config
- Check `backend/src/lib/config.ts`: MODELS.GEMINI_MAIN must be called first
- Check `.env` for GOOGLE_API_KEY value (not empty, not typo'd)

### Step 3: Record Baseline

Save screenshot or CSV of results. Name it: `metrics_baseline_2026-08-16_preoptim.csv`
Will compare against post-staging metrics.

## Staging Deployment

### Step 1: Ensure Migration Applied

Staging DB must have pg_trgm enabled. Check:

```bash
# SSH to staging DB or Supabase SQL editor
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';
```

If empty, apply migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy --skip-generate
```

Verify indexes created:
```bash
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('Project', 'Builder') 
AND indexname LIKE '%trgm%';
```

Expected: `idx_project_name_trgm`, `idx_builder_name_trgm`, `idx_project_sector_trgm`

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging

```bash
# If using Vercel
vercel deploy --prod --scope=realtypals-staging

# If using other platform (render, railway, fly)
git push staging main
# Platform auto-deploys on push
```

Wait for build + deploy complete (~3-5 min). Check deployment logs for errors.

### Step 3: Run Smoke Tests

**Chat flow test:**
```
1. Open https://staging.realtypals.com
2. Message: "3BHK in Sector 150 under 1.5 crore"
3. Expected: Response within 3s, projects returned, early "status: thinking" event visible
4. Check browser DevTools → Network → observe SSE stream includes "status" event first
```

**Meta-awareness test:**
```
1. After initial search, message: "what have you assumed about me?"
2. Expected: Response summarizing budget/sector/BHK captured
```

**Fuzzy matching test:**
```
1. Message: "godrej" (misspell of "Godrej Woods")
2. Expected: Correctly matches despite typo, or falls back to JS Levenshtein
3. Check backend logs: [CHAT:TRGM_MATCH] vs [CHAT:TRGM_UNAVAILABLE] vs Levenshtein path taken
```

**Proactive follow-up test:**
```
1. After project recommendations, watch SSE stream
2. Expected: 'followup' event received with suggestion like "Compare [project A] with [project B]?"
3. Check frontend console: SSE event handling for followup type
```

### Step 4: Monitor Metrics for 2 Hours

Open staging analytics dashboard:
- **Chat latency:** P50 <1.5s, P95 <3s (early status event = perceived latency lower)
- **Error rate:** <0.5% (no new crashes from code changes)
- **Provider calls:** Gemini proportion (should be 60%+ if key configured)
- **Token spend:** Compare against baseline. Target: 10-15% reduction from cost optimizations

If metrics look good → proceed to production.
If issues found → check logs, roll back commit if needed, fix in new PR.

## Major Metrics to Track (Production)

Track these before → after commit `43951fc` to quantify impact:

### Cost Metrics
```sql
-- Daily cost by provider (before vs after)
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  provider,
  SUM(cost_usd) as daily_cost
FROM ai_usage_event
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), provider
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Cost per chat session
SELECT 
  session_id,
  COUNT(*) as calls,
  SUM(prompt_tokens) as input_tokens,
  SUM(completion_tokens) as output_tokens,
  SUM(cost_usd) as session_cost
FROM ai_usage_event
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY session_id
ORDER BY session_cost DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Latency Metrics
From PostHog or application logs:

- **P50 response time:** Target <1.5s (was 2.0-2.5s before parallelization + early status event)
- **P95 response time:** Target <3s
- **First token time:** Measure SSE 'status' event arrival vs 'token' event. Early status masks up to 1.5s latency.

### Intent Quality
```sql
-- Fuzzy match success rate (if tracked)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_project_lookups,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN fuzzy_matched THEN 1 END) as fuzzy_matches,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN fuzzy_matched THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as fuzzy_match_pct
FROM chat_session
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### Compression Effectiveness
```sql
-- Chat history compression: are we hitting threshold at 8+ messages?
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as sessions_compressed,
  ROUND(AVG(message_count_before)::numeric, 1) as avg_msg_before_compress,
  ROUND(AVG(message_count_after)::numeric, 1) as avg_msg_after_compress
FROM chat_compression_log
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

**Savings Calculation:**
```
Before: 14msg * 500 tokens/msg = 7000 tokens/session
After:  8msg * 500 tokens/msg = 4000 tokens/session
Savings: 3000 tokens/session * 1000 sessions/day * 30 days = 90M tokens/month
Cost: 90M * (0.075/1M input) = $6.75/month saved per month
```

## Shift to Production

### Step 1: Final Sanity Check

```bash
# Ensure all tests pass
npm run test

# Ensure TypeScript clean
npx tsc --noEmit

# Ensure build succeeds
npm run build
```

All must pass green before prod.

### Step 2: Create Production Release Tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0-phase5-optimization \
  -m "Phase 0-5: Cost/latency/trust opt + chat parity. Commit 43951fc"
git push origin v1.0.0-phase5-optimization
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Vercel
vercel deploy --prod

# Other platforms
git push main v1.0.0-phase5-optimization
# Platform deploys tagged version
```

Monitor deployment in platform dashboard. Wait for all regions healthy (~5-10 min).

### Step 4: Health Check (First 30 Minutes)

```bash
# Monitor error rate in real-time (Sentry or PostHog)
# Expected: <0.5% error increase from pre-deploy baseline

# Monitor critical paths:
#  - Chat completion API: /api/v1/chat
#  - Session retrieval: /api/v1/chat/session/list
#  - Project search: /api/v1/projects

# If error spike detected:
#  - Check backend logs for crash pattern
#  - If deterministic: git revert 43951fc, git push main, re-deploy
#  - If random: wait 5min, check again (cache warming)
```

### Step 5: Rollout Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Canary** | 30 min | 5% traffic to v1.0.0-phase5-optimization, 95% to stable |
| **Ramp** | 2 hours | Gradually increase to 25% → 50% → 75% |
| **Full** | Ongoing | 100% traffic to new version, mark stable |

Most platforms (Vercel, Render, Fly) do gradual rollout by default. Check dashboard for current percentage.

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Validation (6 Hours)

Compare production metrics against staging baseline:

| Metric | Staging Baseline | Production 6h | Status |
|--------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Avg chat latency (p50) | ___ | ___ | ✅/🔴 |
| Avg chat latency (p95) | ___ | ___ | ✅/🔴 |
| Gemini call % | ___ | ___ | ✅/🔴 |
| Error rate | ___ | ___ | ✅/🔴 |
| Daily cost (USD) | ___ | ___ | ✅/🔴 |

If any metric degrades significantly:
- Check backend logs for new error pattern
- Verify migration applied on prod DB (`SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm'`)
- If cache indexes missing, manually apply migration
- If logic error, git revert, re-deploy

### Step 7: Announce & Document

In MEMORY.md or public release notes:

```markdown

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If production shows issues within 2 hours:

```bash
# Revert commit
git revert 43951fc
git push main

# Deploy reverted version
vercel deploy --prod

# Wait 5 min for health stabilization

# Create incident summary
# Notify team: "Reverted Phase 0-5 due to [specific error]. Investigation ongoing."
```

Once root cause fixed in new PR, re-deploy.

## Monitoring Checklist (First Week)

Run daily:

- [ ] Chat error rate <0.5%
- [ ] P95 latency <3s sustained
- [ ] Gemini calls >60% of total
- [ ] Daily cost trending down vs baseline
- [ ] No new Sentry errors in `chat-router.ts` or AI integration
- [ ] Meta-awareness queries returning correctly
- [ ] Fuzzy project matching working (check logs for TRGM match success)

After 1 week, if all green: Phase 0-5 complete. Ship follow-up phases.

## FAQ

**Q: What if Gemini API key is not set?**
A: Chat will silently fall back to Groq (slower, more expensive). Check `.env` for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If missing, add it and re-deploy.

**Q: Can I skip the staging step?**
A: Not recommended. Staging catches pg_trgm index issues, fuzzy match bugs, and configuration errors before prod.

**Q: What's the expected cost reduction?**
A: 10-15% from compression + minification alone. If Gemini adoption is high (>60%), additional 20-30% from model cost difference.

**Q: When should I clean up old chat sessions?**
A: After 1 month of stable operation. Add a cron job to delete sessions older than 30 days (GDPR compliance + perf).

**Q: How do I verify the migration is actually running?**
A: Connect to DB, run: `SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE '%trgm%';` Expected 3 rows.
