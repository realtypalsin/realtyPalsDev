Yes. What you are doing with RealtyPals is actually **very close to the right architecture**.

The key insight is this:

> **Do not make the LLM responsible for presentation. Make the LLM responsible for meaning/data, and make RealtyPals responsible for presentation.**

The table in your screenshot is almost certainly not something you should try to reproduce by asking the model to generate Markdown. The model should return **structured information**, and your frontend should decide that structured information becomes a table, cards, metrics, maps, etc.

OpenAI's Structured Outputs are specifically designed for this kind of application: the model can be constrained to return data matching a JSON schema rather than generating presentation-oriented text. ([OpenAI][1])

---

# 1. What is probably happening inside ChatGPT

I cannot see OpenAI's private frontend implementation, so I can't literally reverse engineer their proprietary code.

But architecturally, the screenshot strongly suggests something like this:

```text
                    USER
                     │
                     ▼
              ┌─────────────┐
              │     LLM     │
              │ reasoning   │
              └──────┬──────┘
                     │
                     ▼
             Structured result
                     │
          ┌──────────┴──────────┐
          │                     │
       Text block           Table block
          │                     │
       Renderer              Renderer
          │                     │
          └──────────┬──────────┘
                     ▼
              ChatGPT Frontend
```

Instead of:

```text
LLM
 ↓
"Here is a markdown table..."
 ↓
Markdown parser
 ↓
HTML table
```

they can conceptually have something more like:

```json
{
  "type": "table",
  "title": "Running Shoe Comparison",
  "columns": [
    "Category",
    "Deviate Nitro 3",
    "Adizero EVO SL"
  ],
  "rows": [
    ["Speed", "9/10", "9.5/10"],
    ["Cushioning", "9/10", "8.5/10"],
    ["Comfort", "9/10", "8.5/10"]
  ]
}
```

Then **the frontend owns everything visual**:

```text
type = table
        ↓
<Table>
        ↓
CSS
        ↓
borders
spacing
typography
responsive behaviour
hover states
copy button
horizontal scrolling
etc.
```

That is the important part for RealtyPals.

---

# 2. Your current approach is actually better

You said:

> Earlier I was asking the AI provider specifically to give me the data in table format.

That's the approach I would move away from.

You don't want:

```text
Prompt:
Give me the answer as a Markdown table.
Use these columns...
Do not add...
Make it visually clean...
...
```

Because you're spending tokens asking the model to solve a **frontend problem**.

Instead:

```text
LLM
 ↓
"What information should be displayed?"
 ↓
Structured data
 ↓
RealtyPals UI renderer
 ↓
Beautiful table
```

The LLM doesn't need to know whether the final output is:

* a table
* cards
* a property carousel
* a map
* a price breakdown
* a comparison matrix
* a timeline
* a chart

Your application decides.

---

# 3. Think of RealtyPals as having a "UI language"

This is the architecture I would recommend for RealtyPals.

Define a small set of **UI primitives**.

For example:

```text
TEXT
TABLE
PROPERTY_CARD
PROPERTY_GRID
COMPARISON
METRIC
MAP
CHART
LIST
CALLOUT
```

Then your AI isn't generating HTML or Markdown.

It is effectively saying:

```text
I want to display:
COMPARISON
```

and supplying the data.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "comparison",
  "title": "Sector 150 vs Sector 137",
  "columns": ["Factor", "Sector 150", "Sector 137"],
  "rows": [
    ["Average price", "₹1.8 Cr", "₹1.2 Cr"],
    ["Connectivity", "9/10", "8/10"],
    ["Rental demand", "8/10", "9/10"]
  ]
}
```

Your frontend knows:

```javascript
if (block.type === "comparison") {
    return <ComparisonTable {...block} />;
}
```

That's it.

---

# 4. But there is an even better approach for RealtyPals

I wouldn't actually let the AI freely choose arbitrary JSON structures for every answer.

Create a **fixed response protocol**.

Something like:

```json
{
  "answer": "...",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "table",
      "data": {}
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "data": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Then define your allowed components.

For example:

### Text

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Sector 150 is generally better for..."
}
```

### Table

```json
{
  "type": "table",
  "columns": ["Factor", "Sector 150", "Sector 137"],
  "rows": [
    ["Price", "₹1.8 Cr", "₹1.2 Cr"],
    ["Connectivity", "Excellent", "Very good"]
  ]
}
```

### Property card

```json
{
  "type": "property",
  "id": "prop_4821"
}
```

Notice something important here.

**Don't make the LLM return the entire property.**

If RealtyPals already has:

```text
prop_4821
```

the model can return:

```json
{
  "type": "property",
  "id": "prop_4821"
}
```

Then your backend/frontend retrieves the actual property.

That can save a **huge amount of tokens**.

---

# 5. This is where RealtyPals can become very efficient

Imagine the user asks:

> Show me the best 3 BHK properties in Sector 150 under ₹2 crore with good rental potential.

Your database already contains:

```text
Property ID
Price
Location
Bedrooms
Area
Developer
Amenities
Rental yield
...
```

Don't send all 500 properties to the LLM.

Your architecture should be:

```text
USER
 │
 ▼
LLM
 │
 │ understands intent
 ▼
DATABASE QUERY
 │
 ▼
Top 10 matching properties
 │
 ▼
LLM
 │
 │ selects/ranks/explains
 ▼
Property IDs
 │
 ▼
REALTY PALS FRONTEND
 │
 ▼
Beautiful property cards
```

The LLM might ultimately return:

```json
{
  "type": "property_grid",
  "properties": [
    "P102",
    "P381",
    "P774"
  ]
}
```

Your frontend renders:

```text
┌────────────────┐ ┌────────────────┐ ┌────────────────┐
│     IMAGE      │ │     IMAGE      │ │     IMAGE      │
│                │ │                │ │                │
│ 3 BHK          │ │ 3 BHK          │ │ 3 BHK          │
│ ₹1.85 Cr       │ │ ₹1.92 Cr       │ │ ₹1.75 Cr       │
│ Sector 150     │ │ Sector 150     │ │ Sector 150     │
│ ⭐ 8.7/10       │ │ ⭐ 8.5/10       │ │ ⭐ 8.3/10       │
└────────────────┘ └────────────────┘ └────────────────┘
```

The LLM never generated any of that UI.

---

# 6. This also solves your token problem

Let's compare.

### Bad approach

LLM generates:

```markdown
| Property | Location | Price | Area | Rental Yield |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ATS... | Sector 150 | ₹1.85 Cr | 1850 sqft | 4.2% |
| Godrej... | Sector 150 | ₹1.92 Cr | 1920 sqft | 4.0% |
```

You're paying for:

* column names
* `|`
* `---`
* repeated formatting
* Markdown syntax
* values
* explanatory text

### Better

```json
{
  "t": "table",
  "c": ["Property", "Location", "Price", "Area", "Yield"],
  "r": [
    ["ATS", "S150", "1.85Cr", "1850", "4.2%"],
    ["Godrej", "S150", "1.92Cr", "1920", "4.0%"]
  ]
}
```

And even better for database-backed entities:

```json
{
  "t": "property_grid",
  "ids": ["P102", "P381"]
}
```

The last one is extremely cheap.

---

# 7. Don't make the JSON unnecessarily verbose

This is a subtle but important optimization.

Don't do:

```json
{
  "response_type": "property_comparison_table",
  "table_title": "Comparison of Properties",
  "table_columns": [
    "Property Name",
    "Property Location",
    "Property Price"
  ],
  "table_rows": [...]
}
```

You can have a compact internal protocol:

```json
{
  "t": "table",
  "c": ["Property", "Location", "Price"],
  "r": [...]
}
```

But there is a tradeoff.

**Do not aggressively compress the schema if it makes the model less reliable.**

Your ideal is:

> **small enough to be cheap, explicit enough to be reliable.**

---

# 8. Use Structured Outputs instead of saying "return JSON"

This is particularly important.

Don't rely solely on:

> "Return valid JSON."

Use the provider's actual structured-output/schema functionality.

OpenAI's Structured Outputs can enforce that the response conforms to your supplied JSON Schema, rather than merely hoping the model follows the requested format. ([OpenAI][1])

For example, conceptually:

```javascript
const RealtyResponse = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    answer: {
      type: "string"
    },
    blocks: {
      type: "array",
      items: {
        // your allowed UI structure
      }
    }
  },
  required: ["answer", "blocks"],
  additionalProperties: false
};
```

Then the model can't suddenly decide:

```text
"Here's a Markdown table..."
```

when your application expects structured data.

The current OpenAI SDK also supports parsing structured outputs directly into typed objects. ([GitHub][2])

---

# 9. Separate "content generation" from "UI generation"

This is probably the biggest architectural improvement I would make to RealtyPals.

Think of three layers:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│             REALTY UI              │
│                                    │
│ Cards / Tables / Maps / Charts     │
└─────────────────▲──────────────────┘
                  │
                  │ structured data
                  │
┌─────────────────┴──────────────────┐
│          RESPONSE ORCHESTRATOR     │
│                                    │
│ decides what components are needed │
└─────────────────▲──────────────────┘
                  │
                  │
┌─────────────────┴──────────────────┐
│                AI                  │
│                                    │
│ reasoning / extraction / ranking   │
└─────────────────▲──────────────────┘
                  │
          ┌───────┴────────┐
          │                │
       Database           Web
```

This is much more scalable than:

```text
LLM → Markdown → frontend
```

---

# 10. For RealtyPals specifically, I'd create these components

I'd start with maybe **8 components**.

| Component       | Purpose                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `text`          | Normal explanation        |
| `property_card` | One property              |
| `property_grid` | Multiple properties       |
| `table`         | Comparisons               |
| `metric`        | Price, yield, score, etc. |
| `comparison`    | Area/project comparison   |
| `map`           | Geographic results        |
| `chart`         | Price/rental trends       |

Then your LLM has a very limited vocabulary.

For example:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "These are the strongest options..."
    },
    {
      "type": "property_grid",
      "ids": ["P12", "P91", "P102"]
    },
    {
      "type": "comparison",
      "columns": ["Factor", "P12", "P91"],
      "rows": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

Your frontend does the rest.

---

# 11. And this is where ChatGPT-style polish comes from

The "beautification" isn't necessarily the AI.

A large part of it is the renderer.

For example, your `TableRenderer` can automatically do:

```text
TableRenderer
│
├── responsive layout
├── sticky header
├── column sizing
├── number formatting
├── currency formatting
├── truncation
├── horizontal scroll
├── mobile layout
├── typography
├── spacing
├── borders
├── hover behaviour
└── copy functionality
```

The AI simply supplies:

```text
rows
columns
```

That's why you can get the **same visual quality every time**.

---

# 12. You can go one step further: semantic components

For RealtyPals, I would actually avoid generic tables wherever possible.

Suppose the AI returns:

```json
{
  "type": "metric",
  "label": "Rental Yield",
  "value": 4.2,
  "unit": "%"
}
```

Your frontend can automatically render:

```text
Rental Yield
   4.2%
```

Or:

```json
{
  "type": "score",
  "label": "Investment Score",
  "value": 8.7,
  "max": 10
}
```

Frontend:

```text
Investment Score

█████████░  8.7/10
```

This is much better than asking an LLM to invent visual formatting.

---

# 13. The biggest token-saving trick: IDs instead of data

This deserves emphasis.

Suppose you have 20 properties.

Bad:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "price": "...",
      "location": "...",
      "area": "...",
      "developer": "...",
      "amenities": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

Better:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    "P123",
    "P847",
    "P921"
  ]
}
```

Then:

```text
Frontend
   ↓
GET /properties?ids=P123,P847,P921
   ↓
Database
```

Your LLM becomes a **decision engine**, not a database.

That is exactly how I would think about RealtyPals.

---

# 14. Web search should follow the same principle

You mentioned earlier that you want RealtyPals to:

> get data from the database, and if necessary search the web.

Do **not** give the LLM the entire web result and ask it to rewrite everything.

Instead:

```text
User
 ↓
Intent detection
 ↓
Can database answer?
 ├── YES → DB
 │
 └── NO
      ↓
   Web search
      ↓
   Extract relevant facts
      ↓
   Normalize
      ↓
   Answer
```

And your normalized web data might become:

```json
{
  "source": "https://...",
  "title": "...",
  "facts": [
    {
      "label": "Launch date",
      "value": "2026"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then RealtyPals decides how to display it.

---

# 15. Prompt caching is another major optimization

There's another part you should implement.

Your RealtyPals system prompt might contain:

```text
You are RealtyPals...
You understand Indian real estate...
Here are your rules...
Here are your tools...
Here are your UI components...
Here are your database rules...
...
```

Don't rebuild this inefficiently every request.

Keep the **stable instructions at the beginning** and put user-specific information later. OpenAI explicitly recommends this arrangement for prompt caching. ([OpenAI Developers][3])

For supported models, cached input can be substantially cheaper than uncached input; for example, the current GPT-5.5 page lists $5/M input vs $0.50/M cached input. ([OpenAI Developers][4])

And the current GPT-5.6 API supports explicit prompt-cache breakpoints and cache keys. ([OpenAI Developers][5])

So structure your request roughly as:

```text
[STATIC]
RealtyPals system instructions
Database schema
Tool definitions
UI schema
Domain rules

[CACHED]

[DYNAMIC]
User question
Current database results
Current web results
```

That is much better than changing the beginning of the prompt on every request.

---

# 16. Another mistake: putting the schema inside the prompt

You may currently be doing something like:

```text
You must respond using this format:

{
  "type": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "columns": "...",
  ...
}

Here are the rules...
```

Don't.

If your provider supports Structured Outputs, put the schema in the **API's schema mechanism**, rather than explaining the schema repeatedly in natural language.

OpenAI's current model guidance explicitly recommends using Structured Outputs instead of describing the expected output schema in the prompt. ([OpenAI Developers][3])

That gives you:

```text
Prompt:
"Answer the user's real-estate question."

API:
Structured output schema
        ↓
Model
        ↓
Validated structured object
```

---

# 17. I would build RealtyPals like this

Here is the architecture I'd recommend for your project:

```

---

# 18. Your actual response protocol could look like this

I'd make something along these lines:

```json
{
  "answer": "I found three strong options.",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "property_grid",
      "ids": ["P102", "P381", "P774"]
    },
    {
      "type": "table",
      "columns": ["Factor", "P102", "P381", "P774"],
      "rows": [
        ["Price", "1.82Cr", "1.91Cr", "1.76Cr"],
        ["Yield", "4.2%", "3.9%", "4.4%"],
        ["Score", "8.9", "8.5", "8.7"]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And your frontend:

```typescript
switch (block.type) {
  case "text":
    return <TextBlock {...block} />;

  case "property_grid":
    return <PropertyGrid ids={block.ids} />;

  case "table":
    return <DataTable {...block} />;

  case "chart":
    return <Chart {...block} />;

  case "map":
    return <PropertyMap {...block} />;
}
```

Now **you control the entire visual experience**.

---

# 19. One important optimization I would NOT do

Don't try to recreate ChatGPT's frontend by making the AI generate:

```html
<div>
<table>
<tr>
...
```

or:

```markdown
### Comparison

| ... |
```

or even huge CSS/formatting instructions.

That's fundamentally backwards.

Your model should produce **semantic information**.

Your application should produce **pixels**.

---

# 20. The really interesting part: you can make RealtyPals better than ChatGPT here

Because RealtyPals is domain-specific.

ChatGPT needs generic components.

You can have components specifically designed for real estate:

```text
PropertyCard
ProjectCard
DeveloperCard
LocalityCard
InvestmentScore
RentalYield
PriceTrend
ConnectivityScore
BuilderScore
LegalRisk
AmenityMatrix
LocationComparison
PropertyComparison
EMICalculator
PriceBreakdown
InvestmentVerdict
```

Then a RealtyPals response could look like:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BEST OPTIONS IN SECTOR 150          │
│                                     │

The AI only needs to provide the **underlying facts and judgment**.

# 21. If your primary goal is minimum tokens

My priority order would be:

### ① Database first

Don't send data to the LLM that your application can retrieve itself.

### ② IDs instead of full objects

```text
P102
```

instead of the complete property.

### ③ Structured Outputs

Don't ask for Markdown.

### ④ Fixed component vocabulary

```text
text
table
property
metric
chart
map
```

### ⑤ Compact schemas

Don't repeat unnecessary field names.

### ⑥ Prompt caching

Keep stable instructions/schema/tool descriptions at the front. ([OpenAI Developers][3])

### ⑦ Short answers by default

Don't ask the model to explain every database field.

### ⑧ Let frontend format numbers

LLM:

```text
18500000
```

Frontend:

```text
₹1.85 Cr
```

LLM:

```text
0.042
```

Frontend:

```text
4.2%
```

That is another small but useful optimization.

# 22. The architecture I'd recommend for your current RealtyPals build

Since you've already moved from:

```text
LLM → Markdown table
```

to:

```text
LLM → data
        ↓
RealtyPals → table
```

**I would keep that direction and take it one step further.**

Move toward:

```text

       RealtyPals Renderer
               │
               ▼
         BEAUTIFUL UI
```

**That is the core concept I would build around.**

And importantly, you do **not** need to train your own LLM just to achieve this. Your "small real-estate LLM" idea can initially be an **orchestrated domain-specific AI layer** sitting on top of your database, tools, web search and a relatively inexpensive model. The differentiation is in your data, retrieval, decision logic, schemas, evaluation and UI—not necessarily in training a model from scratch.

If you're using OpenAI specifically, the current API already supports Structured Outputs, tool calling, web search, and cost-oriented models such as GPT-5.6 Luna, which is explicitly positioned for cost-sensitive/high-volume workloads. ([OpenAI Developers][6])

## What I would do next for RealtyPals

I think the most useful next step is to **design the actual RealtyPals response protocol**, rather than discussing this abstractly.

We can define:

```text
RealtyPalsResponse
        │
        ├── text
        ├── table
        ├── property_card
        ├── property_grid
        ├── comparison
        ├── metric
        ├── chart
        ├── map
        └── sources
```

Then I can give you the **exact JSON Schema + backend architecture + prompt + TypeScript renderer architecture** for it, optimized specifically for **minimum output tokens and maximum UI quality**. That would give you something you can directly plug into your existing RealtyPals implementation rather than just a conceptual explanation.
