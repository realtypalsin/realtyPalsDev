/**
 * How a fact is allowed to be presented to a buyer.
 *
 * Several chat handlers used to fill a gap in the database with a plausible
 * literal and ship it under a "Verified …" heading with confidence: 'HIGH' —
 * e.g. answering "does it have a pool?" with "**Yes**, <project> features an
 * Olympic-Size Swimming Pool" when the project had no amenity rows at all, or
 * printing "₹3,50,000 (Covered)" as a specific project's parking charge.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md is explicit: never invent data, never guess unavailable
 * information, never use fake confidence scores. This module is the one place
 * that decides what to say instead, so the decision cannot drift per handler.
 *
 * Four tiers, and the distinction that matters is per-project vs. market-wide:
 *
 *   verified   read from the database for THIS project. State it plainly.
 *   statutory  fixed by law and identical for every project (UP stamp duty,
 *              registration, GST). Safe to state without a project lookup.
 *   market     genuinely typical for Noida but NOT verified for this project.
 *              Usable, but must carry its qualifier every single time.
 *   missing    we do not hold it. Say so and offer the advisory handoff.
 *
 * A project-specific yes/no — does this building have a pool, what does its
 * parking cost — has no market tier. A market average cannot answer it, and a
 * wrong "yes" is discovered on the site visit, which is exactly the trust
 * failure the product exists to avoid.
