// "My office is in Sector 63" is the most valuable sentence a buyer says, and
// it was the sentence that broke the funnel.
//
// Measured on a 15-turn production run: the buyer said "central noida, sector
// 63 noida in particular for office". Intent extraction put `sector: "Sector
// 63"` on the search, the sector lane found no residential inventory there —
// correctly, it is a commercial district — and answered "It is a business
// district, not a residential sector. I can't pull the cost sheet or
// availability right now — connect with our advisory team." Then Sector 63
// stayed sticky, so the next two turns were also about Sector 63 and the chips
// still read "Check other configurations in Sector 63" five turns later.
//
// A workplace is not a place to buy. It is the point you measure FROM.

 * the sector is like to live in... The sectors we cover in most depth are
 * Sector 75, Sector 150, Sector 79" — offered three sectors with no relation to
 * the school, verbatim again on the next turn.
