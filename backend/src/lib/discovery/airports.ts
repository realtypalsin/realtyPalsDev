// How far a project is from each airport a Noida buyer actually uses.
//
// `Project.airport_distance_km` holds ONE number, and which airport it means
// is not written down anywhere. Checked against our own coordinates it is
// Jewar: median error 5.5km against Noida International, 23.7km against Delhi
// IGI. That is a real measurement — but it silently answers "how far is the
// airport" with the wrong airport for anyone flying today, because Jewar is
// new and Delhi is where the flights are.
//
// Both distances are computed here from `lat`/`lng`, which every one of the
// 280 projects has and which is the only geo signal in the database we trust
// (the connectivity rows are synthetic — see MEMORY.md, 28 Aug).
//
// Computed, not stored: a derived number in a column drifts from the
// coordinates it came from the moment either is edited, and this costs
// microseconds.
