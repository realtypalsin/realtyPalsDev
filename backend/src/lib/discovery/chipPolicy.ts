// When chips are welcome, and when silence is the better answer.
//
// Chips scored 4.4/10 across a 29-turn adversarial run — the weakest surface in
// the product. On eleven of those turns they related to neither the question nor
// the answer. Two examples set the rules below:
//
//   * A buyer alleging their booking token had been taken and their calls
//     ignored was offered "Top Rated Builders", "Buyer Checklist Before
//     Booking" and "Brokerage & Extra Charges Guide".
//   * A buyer eleven turns into a shortlist was offered "Help me set a budget".
//
// Neither was a generation bug. `emitUiState` filtered chips correctly and then,
// finding none left, INJECTED a generic floor set — the only additive step in an
// otherwise subtractive pipeline. So a turn that had earned no chips got the
// cold-start trio instead of nothing.
//
// A chip is a shortcut for something the buyer plausibly wants next. On a
// grievance, a refusal, or an off-topic aside there is no such thing, and
// offering one reads as not having listened.

/** Turn shapes where any chip is noise. */

   * project drilldown: "View Floor Plans" and "View Cost Sheet & Taxes" were
   * both discarded because "View" is not in the answer text — a chip taking the

   *
   * This is the same shape as the fabrication guard's own history: a blocklist
   * of words that must not appear is unfinishable, and every gap in it discards

   * vocabulary we actually hold, so a token is only treated as a claim when it
   * is genuinely part of a project name. Everything else — verbs, UI nouns,
   * whatever a future chip says — passes untouched.
