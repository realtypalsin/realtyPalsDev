// Chips scored 4.4/10 across a 29-turn adversarial run — the weakest surface in
// the product. On eleven turns they related to neither the question nor the
// answer. The cause was not generation: `emitUiState` filtered correctly and
// then INJECTED a generic floor set when nothing survived, so a turn that had
// earned no chips got the cold-start trio instead of none.
