// That column is `Json?` and is written with two incompatible shapes by
// different branches of the chat handler:
//
//   - an array of project id strings, when a project context is resolved
//   - an array of ScoredProject objects, when a search or the end-of-turn
//     persist writes the result set
//
// Both read sites used to be unchecked casts (`as string[]` and
// `as unknown as ScoredProject[]`), so each one was wrong on any turn where the
// other branch had written last. The id reader in particular fed
// postProcessIntent(), so a buyer saying "tell me more about it" could silently
// lose the focused project.
//
// Normalising on read fixes both directions without a migration and without
// having to make every writer agree.
