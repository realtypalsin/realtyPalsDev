/**
 * Phase 0: Query Classification Taxonomy
 *
 * Deterministic + LLM fallback approach to classify user queries into:
 * - DISCOVERY: User wants recommendations (default fallback)
 * - DRILLDOWN: User wants details on specific project/attribute
 * - RANKING: User wants comparison/ranking of options
 * - COMPARISON: User wants to compare 2+ named projects
 * - SUMMARY: User wants overview/summary
 * - ADVISORY: User wants advice/opinion
 * - CLARIFY: Bot needs clarification before proceeding
 *
 * Deterministic pre-pass evaluates before LLM fallback.
 * LLM fallback folds queryKind into intent extraction (no extra round-trip).
