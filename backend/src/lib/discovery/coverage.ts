// "I have Gurgaon in mind."
//
// Measured on a cold funnel run: that message was answered with a confident
// tour of Gurgaon's market — "luxury high-rises and vibrant social
// infrastructure along major axes like Golf Course Extension and the Dwarka
// Expressway" — and never once said we do not cover the city. None of it came
// from a row we hold, about a city we have no inventory in, phrased exactly
// like something we had checked.
//
// `outOfScopeCity` already names the city. All it did was drop the sector
// filter, which is right but silent: with no sector the turn reached the
// general lane, which then free-associated.
//
// The distinction that matters, and the reason this is not one regex: a foreign
// city is a coverage problem when it is where they want to BUY, and a useful
// signal when it is where they WORK. "I have a daily commute to Gurgaon" is the
// single most valuable thing a Noida buyer can tell us — it picks the corridor.
// Declining that message would be worse than the bug it fixes.
