// "What is near this?" — answered from the one geo signal we can stand behind.
//
// WHAT WE HOLD: Project.lat / Project.lng, populated on 280 of 280 rows. That
// is enough to say truthfully how far one project is from another, or from the
// centre of a sector.
//
// WHAT WE DO NOT HOLD, despite appearances:
//   * There is no MetroStation, School or Hospital model. CLAUDE.md's domain
//     list names them; the schema does not contain them.
//   * The Connectivity table looks like the answer and is not. It holds 6,840
//     rows that are the same ~24 landmark names repeated across all 280
//     projects — every project claims a "Noida - Greater Noida Expressway" and
//     a "Delhi Public School (DPS) & Lotus Valley International" row. The
//     distances vary per project, which makes it look real, but the landmark
//     set is identical everywhere. It is seeded data, not surveyed data.
//
// So a question about proximity to a METRO, a SCHOOL or a HOSPITAL cannot be
// answered honestly at all, and this module says so rather than reaching for
// the Connectivity rows. Asked "projects near a metro station in noida" on
// 30 Aug, the assistant instead invented a Blue Line and an Aqua Line corridor
// with specific sector numbers. Nothing in our database says any of that.
//
// Distances here are STRAIGHT-LINE. A straight line is not a commute, and
// every caller is expected to label it as such — 2 km across the Hindon is not
// 2 km of driving.
