// backend/src/lib/turnTimer.ts
//
// Where a turn's wall clock actually goes.
//
// Discovery turns measure 18-20s in production while the same retrieval runs in
// 79-228ms locally and the model leg measures 3.8s. That leaves ~14s
// unaccounted for, and every latency assumption made without measurement this
// week has been wrong — the prompt was blamed before it was profiled, and the
// answer turned out to be input size rather than generation.
//
// So: one timer, marks at the real boundaries, emitted on the `done` event and
// logged as a single line. Cheap enough to leave on permanently — a handful of
// Date.now() calls against a turn that costs seconds — and it means the next
// person to ask "why is this slow" reads an answer instead of forming a theory.
