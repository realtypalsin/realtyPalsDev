/**
 * Field exposure policy for Project data leaving the server.
 *
 * Every handler that reads a project and puts any part of it into an LLM prompt
 * or an SSE frame must go through here. Two problems this exists to stop:
 *
 * 1. PII / cross-tenant leaks. `Project` has relations to other people's data —
 *    `saved_by` (SavedProperty), `chat_sessions` (ChatSession) and
 *    `property_feedback` (PropertyFeedback). A single `include: { saved_by: true }`
 *    in a future handler would put other users' records into a prompt. Nothing
 *    prevented that before; FORBIDDEN_RELATIONS + assertNoForbiddenRelations do.
 *
 * 2. Internal mechanics leaking. `embedding` is a pgvector column (enormous, and
 *    it would be shredded into tokens), `ai_search_keywords` exposes how ranking
 *    and matching work, and `builder_theme` carries a commercial branding
 *    arrangement including `active_until`. None of these belong in an answer.
 *
 * The allowlist is a Prisma `select`, so enforcement happens at query time and
 * the forbidden columns are never read at all. `redactProject` is defence in
 * depth for rows that arrive from somewhere else.
 *
 * Adding a column to schema.prisma does NOT automatically expose it: it is
 * absent from PROJECT_PUBLIC_SELECT until someone classifies it here, and
 * projectExposure.test.ts fails on any unclassified column so that decision
 * cannot be skipped.
