// The affordability arithmetic, done in code.
//
// The 31 Aug audit rated "I earn 2 lakh a month, what can I afford in Noida?"
// one of the two weakest answers in the set, for two reasons that share a
// cause. It took 45.5 seconds, and it quoted a comfortable EMI range of
// "₹80,000 and ₹1,000,000 per month" — the second figure is ten lakh, on a two
// lakh income. The model meant ₹1,00,000 and slipped a digit crossing between
// Indian lakh notation and plain numerals.
//
// That is not a prompt problem. It is arithmetic, and this codebase already
// decided how to handle arithmetic the buyer will act on: `marketTable.ts`
// renders tables in code rather than asking the model to draw them, because a
// figure we computed cannot be off by a factor of ten. Same rule here.
//
// The latency has the same root: with no numbers in hand the turn classifies
// as `reasoning`, gets the big model and a 1,024-token thinking budget, and
// spends it deriving what two lines of code produce exactly.
