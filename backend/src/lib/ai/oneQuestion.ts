// One question per turn, enforced on the bytes.
//
// The prompt has asked for this in three places for weeks, and it is still the
// most reliably broken rule in the product. Measured on a single funnel run,
// after the rule was tightened with two worked counter-examples:
//
//   "…do you have a specific micro-market or sector in Noida in mind, or would
//    you like to narrow down a shortlist based on your preferred budget and
//    room configuration?"
//   "Are you aiming for a ready-to-move 3 or 4 BHK, and what is your target
//    budget for your family's home?"
//
// Three answers requested in one breath, both times. A buyer facing that is
// filling in a form, which is the thing this product exists not to be.
//
// A prompt rule is a request; this runs after generation, so it cannot be
// talked out of. Same reasoning as the table stripper and the over-promise
// softener.
//
// Deliberately conservative in two ways. An either/or — "X, or would you rather
// Y?" — is left alone: that is one decision with two options, which is how a
// good advisor narrows things, and cutting it would leave a worse question. And
// it only ever TRIMS; it never rewrites a clause or invents a connective, so
// the worst case is a shorter question rather than a wrong one.

/**
 * `, or do you have a budget in mind` — a second ask wearing the first's
 * question mark.
 *
 * The either/or exemption below is right for two options of the SAME slot:
 * "expressway connectivity, or closer to the metro?" is one decision with two
 * answers, and cutting it leaves a worse question. It was too broad for two
 * DIFFERENT slots. Measured live:
 *
 *   "Are you looking in a specific area like Sector 137, 150, or 168, or do you
 *    have a budget in mind?"
 *
 * Area and budget are separate slots, so that is two questions and one question
 * mark — which is exactly the form the mark-counting check cannot see.
 *
 * The signal is a second finite verb with its own subject after the "or".
 * "…, or the metro?" has none and survives; "…, or DO YOU HAVE…" starts a new
 * predicate and is cut.
 *
 * Narrowed once already, and the ceiling is worth stating. "or would you
 * RATHER be near the metro?" tripped the first version, and it should not have:
 * "rather" and "prefer" mark a restatement of the same choice, so that is still
 * one decision with two options. They are excluded.
 *
 * What remains is a heuristic, not a parser. A same-slot alternative phrased
 * with some other verb ("…, or is the metro more important?") will still be
 * cut, and the cost of that is a slightly shorter question rather than a wrong
 * one — which is the direction this file always errs in.
