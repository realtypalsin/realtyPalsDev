// than it sounds: both sit directly below three Gemini legs that are cooling
// down on a depleted balance, so they are the legs most turns actually land on.
//
// Groq and OpenAI keep their own copies of this logic. They are not touched
// here — this exists so the two legs that had nothing get one implementation
// rather than two more.
