// What the assistant already knows about this buyer, as a few lines for the
// prompt.
//
// `buildGeneralConversationalPrompt` took `{userMessage, webContext, city,
// hasVerifiedData}` — no intent, no focus project, no history. So the general
// lane was stateless, and on a 15-turn production run that produced the two
// worst answers in it:
//
//   T10  "tell me about the first one"  -> an essay about Jewar Airport, because
//                                          nothing told it what had been listed
//   T13  "what are the negatives"       -> generic Noida risks, closing with
//                                          "leaning toward Sector 150?" — a
//                                          question the buyer had answered six
//                                          turns earlier by naming Sector 63
//
// CLAUDE.md already requires this ("Persistent memory within a session,
// referenced naturally... use them, don't just store them"). The data was
// stored and never passed.
