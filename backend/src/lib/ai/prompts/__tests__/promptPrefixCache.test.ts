/**
 * The system prompt must stay invariant-head-first.
 *
 * Prefix caching bills only what it cannot match against the previous request,
 * and it matches from the start of the prompt to the first differing byte.
 * budgetRules and toolsSection both vary per turn — toolsSection is filtered by
 * filterToolsByIntent(queryKind, userMessage) — and both used to sit near the
 * front, so every rule after them was re-billed at full rate on every turn no
 * matter what caching was switched on.
 *
 * Moving them to the tail took the shared prefix from 39% to ~84% of the
 * prompt. This guards that: dropping a per-turn value back into the head would
 * quietly undo it, and nothing else in the suite would notice.
