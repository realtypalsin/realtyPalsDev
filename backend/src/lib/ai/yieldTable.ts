// backend/src/lib/ai/yieldTable.ts
//
// Rental yield and price change, computed from our own rows and rendered in code.
//
// Three systems answered these questions and they contradicted each other, so
// the buyer got a refusal, a hedge or a constant depending on which one won:
//
//   * `guardrails.ts` blocks any "N% returns / CAGR / ROI" claim outright.
//   * HARD RULE 20 in `prompts/base.ts` forbids ROI projections.
//   * `tools/financialCalculators.ts` projects 12% residential and 18%
//     commercial CAGR from hardcoded constants, and `generateIntelligence.ts`
//     writes "Noida typically sees 5-8% annual appreciation" into stored
//     narrative.
//
// The first two are right and the third should never have existed. But "we don't
// answer that" is the wrong resolution, because **we hold the data for the honest
// half of the question**: every one of the 65 sector rows carries both
// `avg_rent_3bhk_monthly` and `avg_price_per_sqft`, and we hold 371 priced 3BHK
// unit types. Gross rental yield is division, on two numbers we already show the
// buyer elsewhere.
//
// The dividing line this file draws, and the reason it is drawn here rather than
// in a prompt:
//
//   YIELD IS MEASURED.       Recorded rent over a real asking price. Printable.
//   PAST CHANGE IS RECORDED. Two price points we actually stored, and the change
//                            between them — but only where the points came from
//                            somewhere. 1,400 of our 1,680 `price_history` rows
//                            carry `source: 'historical_benchmark'` and step by
//                            an identical amount each quarter (8990, 10540,
//                            12090 …). That is a generated arithmetic series,
//                            not a market observation, and quoting a CAGR off it
//                            would be the most convincing fabrication available:
//                            specific, plotted, and nobody can check it.
//   FUTURE RETURN IS NOT OURS TO STATE. No projection, no CAGR forward, at any
//                            confidence. The guardrail stays.
