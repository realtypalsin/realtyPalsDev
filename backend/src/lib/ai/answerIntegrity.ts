//
// One gate every finished answer passes before a buyer reads it.
//
// `toolBlindGuard` already asked "did this leg invent a project?", but only on
// legs that could not call a tool. That was the wrong boundary: measured live,
// the tool-capable Gemini leg answered "What is Skyline Verdant Quartz
// Residency?" — a name that does not exist — with "a prominent high-rise
// residential development in Noida, crafted by **Supertech Limited**", and no
// guard ran at all, because the leg had tools.
//
// Two more classes showed up in the same session, and neither is fabrication:
//
//   "What about the second one?"
//     → "The user asks 'What about the second one?', but the provided verified
//        facts block only contains information for a single project…
//        We only have records for Samridhi Daksh Avenue in Sector 150 Noida,
//        as no second project was provided in the database."
//
// That is the prompt's own scaffolding read aloud to a buyer, wrapped around a
// false claim about our coverage — we hold nineteen projects in Sector 150.
//
//   "Hi"
//     → "We currently maintain verified data on 280 projects across 61 sectors"
//
// which is the shape of our table, told to anyone who types a greeting.
//
// So the gate asks three questions, and they carry different consequences:
//
//   FABRICATION  — a project or registration number from nowhere.  discard
//   META_LEAK    — the answer describes the prompt, or denies data we hold. discard
//   INVENTORY    — a count of what we hold.                        discard
//   FRAMING      — "our database", "in our records".               rewrite
//
// Discard means the turn rolls to the next leg with nothing sent, exactly as a
// provider failure does. Rewrite means the phrase is replaced in place, because
// binning a good answer over a house-style slip is the more expensive error.
