// per corpus run ended mid-sentence — one mid-table-row — and the cut always
// landed on a table-heavy reply. Markdown tables tokenize far denser than
// prose (pipes, separators, digits), so a ceiling set by eyeballing character
// counts is set too low for exactly the answers this product cares most about.
//
// This is close to free. maxTokens is a CEILING, not a target: an answer that
// finishes on its own bills what it generated, so the 97% of turns that were
// never truncated cost the same as before. Only the answers that were being
// cut off pay more, and paying for the rest of a comparison a buyer asked for
// is the trade this file exists to make.
