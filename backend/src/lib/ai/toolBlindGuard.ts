//
// Mistral, Cerebras and Groq carry supportsTools: false. On those legs the
// model cannot call sector_projects, rera_check or any other lookup — it holds
// only whatever the prompt injected. The no-tools prompt block tells it to say
// so. Measured over a 67-query run on 30 Aug, with the billed Gemini balance
// depleted and every turn landing on a tool-blind leg, it did not:
//
//   "best society in sector 137 noida"
//     → **Shriram Suites** | Shriram Properties | STRONG_BUY | OC issued
//       No Shriram row exists. Sector 137 holds ten real projects.
//   "property dealers in sector 75 noida"
//     → Square Yards, PropTiger (Housing.com), each with an invented
//       "UP-RERA Form-7 No. 1023" registration.
//
// Both were graded a pass by the corpus runner and would have been read by a
// buyer as verified. A prompt rule the model ignores is not a control, so this
// is the mechanical one: on a tool-blind leg the finished answer is checked
// against the facts the prompt actually carried, and an answer that names
// something we did not give it is discarded and the turn rolls to the next leg.
//
// Deliberately narrow. It does not judge advice, tone or completeness — only
// whether a name, a registration number or a rival portal appeared from nowhere.
