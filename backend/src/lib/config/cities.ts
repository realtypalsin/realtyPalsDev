 * Sector 62 Gurgaon vs Sector 79 Noida" resolved to `sector: "Sector 62,
 * Noida"` — `normalizeSectorName` keeps only "Sector N" and drops the city —
 * and the buyer was then answered with Noida's Sector 62 inventory. A different
 * city's stock presented as the one they asked about is the "never recommend
 * unsupported cities as available inventory" rule failing silently.
 *
 * Delhi is deliberately absent: it is the reference point for half the commute
 * questions we get ("30 minutes from South Delhi"), and blocking it would break
 * answers that are legitimately about Noida.
