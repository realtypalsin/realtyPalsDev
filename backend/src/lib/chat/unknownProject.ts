/**
 * What to say when a buyer names a project we do not hold.
 *
 * Three behaviours are possible and only one is acceptable:
 *
 *   1. Substitute. Show other projects and let the buyer assume their question
 *      was answered. This is what the code did — a `city contains 'Noida'`
 *      query, eight arbitrary rows printed under "Verified Projects Status",
 *      and a "Recommendation" naming two of them. It is the worst thing this
 *      product can do: the buyer leaves with an answer to a question they did
 *      not ask and no signal that it happened.
 *   2. Refuse flatly. Honest, but a dead end for someone who has heard a real
 *      project name we simply have not onboarded.
 *   3. Say we do not have it, then look — with what the web reports kept
 *      visibly separate from what we verify.
 *
 * This does (3), by delegating to runGroundedAnswer with an ENTITY detection.
 * That path already enforces the grounding contract we want: our own tables
 * first, live web only for the gap, every ungrounded sentence stripped before
 * the buyer sees it, and no raw URLs or provenance tags in the output. Writing
 * a second grounding path here would mean two sets of rules to keep honest.
