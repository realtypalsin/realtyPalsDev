/**
 * Heavy relations are fetched only when the turn is about them.
 *
 * buildProjectFacts has always been topic-gated, so price_history, spec_items
 * and construction_milestones only ever reached the prompt when the buyer asked
 * for them. The query did not know that: it pulled all three on every single
 * turn and the result was discarded. The cost was paid in the database and over
 * the wire, where no amount of prompt gating could reach it.
 *
 * ProjectDna is a separate case. It is in INTERNAL_ONLY_RELATIONS, redactProject
 * strips it before anything is sent to a client, and buildProjectFacts never
 * reads it — so every turn fetched a relation that could not legally be shown to
 * a buyer and that nothing looked at.
