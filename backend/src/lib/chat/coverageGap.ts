// What to do when a buyer names a project we do not hold.
//
// There are two different situations and they must not be conflated:
//
//   "Tell me about Godrej Woods"   — a specific project, by name, that has no
//                                    row. We can say something useful about it
//                                    from the web, and someone should be told
//                                    to add it.
//   "What's good in Noida?"        — a general question. Nothing is missing;
//                                    there is simply no single project being
//                                    asked about, and treating that as a
//                                    coverage gap would log noise and search
//                                    the web for a question the database
//                                    already answers well.
//
// So the gate is narrow on purpose: the buyer must have named something that
// reads like a project, and retrieval must have returned no row for that name.
//
// What comes back is never a project card. A card is a promise that we hold
// verified rows behind it; there are none, and rendering one would be the
// clearest possible version of the fabrication this codebase keeps removing.
// The answer is prose, labelled as unverified, with the handoff to our own
// team — never to another portal, which `sanitizeOutput` enforces on the bytes.
