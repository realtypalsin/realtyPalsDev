// Two of the topic flags computed in chat-router.ts, lifted out because both
// were matching questions they had no business answering and there was nowhere
// to pin a regression test — the rest still live inline among ~20 siblings.
//
// Measured on the demo corpus, 30 Aug 2026: each of these misrouted exactly one
// query, and in both cases the handler that fired answered a different question
// confidently rather than failing, which is the worst way for routing to break.

 * A question about HOW a project is verified, not about who built it.
 *
 * "How do I verify whether a Noida property project is RERA compliant?" was
 * answered with the developer delivery scorecard — six builders, delivery
 * scores, handover delays — because `rera complian` sat in the builder
 * reputation regex and that handler runs first. The buyer asked for a process
 * and got a league table.
 *
 * `check rera` and `verify rera` only ever matched the words adjacent, so the
 * ordinary way to ask it ("verify whether ... is RERA compliant") missed.

 * A request for a payment SCHEDULE, not a mention of money the buyer holds.

 * A bare `down payments?` matched "I earn ₹1.5 lakh per month and have ₹25 lakh
 * available for a down payment — what should I consider?", so an affordability
 * question was answered with the three standard CLP/DP/Flexi structures and a
 * "which project would you like?" It never touched income, EMI or budget.
 *
 * "Down payment" is only a request for a plan when a plan word follows it.
 * Asking what a specific project's down payment IS falls through to the generic
 * path, which reads that project's payment_plans rows from the facts block.
 *
 * Plurals matter: `\bpayment plan\b` does not match "payment plans", which is
 * how buyers and our own chips write it. "Show payment plans for Nirala Diadem"
 * once reached no handler at all.
