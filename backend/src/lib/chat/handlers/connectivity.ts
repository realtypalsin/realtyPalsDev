/**
 * "How far is the metro / the airport / what's the connectivity like?"
 *
 * The branch this replaces built a four-column "verified transit and distance
 * matrix" in which three columns were the same hardcoded string on every row:
 *
 *     const expStr     = 'Noida-Gr Noida Expressway (12–15 mins)'
 *     const airportStr = 'Jewar Airport (45 mins via FNG / Yamuna Exp)'
 *     const infraStr   = 'Fortis / Yatharth Hospital (10 mins)'
 *
 * Every project, regardless of where it actually is, was reported as 12–15
 * minutes from the expressway and 10 minutes from two named hospitals. The
 * metro column fell back to 'Sector 76 / 50 Metro (1.5 km)' — a specific
 * distance invented for any project with no connectivity record.
 *
 * A comparison table whose columns do not vary tells a buyer the projects are
 * equivalent on commute. That is the single dimension they are most likely to
 * decide on, and the real per-project data was sitting unused in the
 * connectivity relation and in the *_distance_km columns.
 *
 * Every cell below is now read from that project's own rows, and a project with
 * no record for a category shows a dash rather than a borrowed figure.
