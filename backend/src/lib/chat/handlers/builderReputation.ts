/**
 * What the numbers in this table actually are.
 *
 * A buyer asking "what is the builder score" is asking two questions, and the
 * second one — on what basis — matters more. These are stored columns on the
 * developer, entered and reviewed by our analysts from delivery history and
 * RERA filings. They are not computed live, not a public rating, and not
 * sourced from the developer. Saying so costs one line and is the difference
 * between a figure a buyer can weigh and a figure they have to trust blindly.
 *
 * This is the same reason `ProjectDna` scores stay internal: an unexplained
 * number presented as a rating is the fake confidence score CLAUDE.md forbids.
 * A number WITH its basis is not that.
 */

  '**How to read this.** Every figure here is a count or a date from completed ' +

  'past projects, not a guarantee about this one.'

/**
 * The developer track record: delivery scores, handover delay, RERA compliance.

 * Answers 'is this builder safe', which sits behind most builder questions a
 * first-time buyer asks. It reads only the builder rows the router already
 * fetched for this turn — no query of its own.
 *
 * Three fabrications were removed from this block before it moved here, and the
 * shape that produced them is worth remembering: a builder with no construction
 * quality score was graded 'A-Grade'; one with no RERA compliance score was
 * labelled 'Verified', asserting a compliance standing we do not hold about the
 * exact subject the buyer is trying to assess; and one with an unknown
 * delivered count was credited with '5+ Projects'. Every dash in this table is
 * now a real gap, and the table says so in words.
 *
 * It declines a builder-vs-builder message — that is a comparison, and the
 * comparison path owns it.
