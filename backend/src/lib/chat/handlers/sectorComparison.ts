   * "Sector 150 vs Sector 128" and badly wrong for a brief:
   *
   *   "I have ₹1.25 crore. I work near Sector 62, my wife works near Sector 135
   *    … Compare Sector 75, Sector 78, Sector 137 and Sector 150"
   *
   * produced a comparison of Sector 62 and Sector 135 — the two WORKPLACES —
   * and reported that Sector 135 has no inventory. The four sectors the buyer
   * actually asked about were never looked at, and the mechanical grader passed
   * it because the answer was long and well-formed.
   *
   * Three or more sectors is a multi-way brief: it belongs on the main advisory
   * path, which sees the whole intent rather than the first two regex hits.

A comparison of ${s1} and ${s2} has just been rendered for the buyer from our own rows — inventory counts, price bands and the landmark societies in each. Do not draw a table and do not restate its figures.

Write three short paragraphs and nothing else:
1. The verdict. Which of the two, and the single distinction that decides it.
2. What the buyer trades away by taking that one. Every choice here costs something; name it.
3. "Choose ${s1} if … choose ${s2} if …" — the condition that flips the answer.

Rows reading "Not recorded" are gaps in our data, not zeros. You may say so; never fill one. No headings, no emoji, around 140 words.`
