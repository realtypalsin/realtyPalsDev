/**
 * "Does Ace Parkway have a stadium or sports city nearby?"
 *
 * Measured: answered with ACE Parkway's own amenity table — the swimming pool,
 * the squash courts, the bowling alley — and never addressed the question. The
 * amenity matcher contains `sports`, so a question about what is AROUND the
 * project was read as a question about what is INSIDE it. Two different facts
 * with almost the same vocabulary.
 *
 * The split that matters: an amenity is something the developer built and we
 * hold in `amenities`; a landmark is something the city built and we hold in
 * `connectivity`, or do not hold at all. Most projects have no stadium row, and
 * "we have no row" is not the same as "there is no stadium" — the honest answer
 * needs a source outside our database.
 *
 * So: our rows first, then the web, each labelled as what it is. A web answer
 * is never presented in the register of a verified one, and it never becomes a
 * card or a recommendation.
