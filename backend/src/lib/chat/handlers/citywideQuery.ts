        `#### RealtyPals Advisory Guide for Working with Advisory Firms:\n` +
        `1. **Verify UP-RERA Agent Registration**: Always verify that the individual advisor and the firm have an active UP-RERA agent license.\n` +
        `2. **Cross-Check Official Builder Cost Sheets**: Channel partner quotes should be verified directly against the developer's official price list, including basic selling price (BSP), floor rise, PLC, and statutory taxes.\n` +

        `1. **Blocked Registry / Pending Authority Dues**: The society has unpaid land dues with the Noida Authority, preventing sub-lease deed execution.\n` +

        `3. **Disadvantageous Floor / Facing**: Stagnant waterbody view, proximity to diesel generator sets/garbage shafts, or ground/top floor heat absorption.\n` +

        `5. **Unpaid IFMS & Sinking Fund Dues**: Seller owes massive maintenance arrears or unpaid transfer charges (TM) to the society.\n\n` +
        `#### Immediate Investigation Protocol:\n` +
        `- Ask for the **latest Encumbrance Certificate (EC)** from the Sub-Registrar Office.\n` +

        const subventionText = `### Regulatory & Legal Status of 20:80 Subvention Schemes (UP RERA & RBI Guidelines)

#### 1. The Short Verdict
**Bank-funded subvention schemes (where a bank disburses 70–80% upfront and the builder promises to pay EMIs on your behalf) are effectively BANNED and strictly prohibited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB).**

However, **pure builder-funded Possession-Linked Plans (PLP)** — where you pay 20% upfront and the remaining 80% directly to the developer upon handover with **no bank loan or EMI involved during construction** — are **100% legal and fully recognized under UP RERA**.

---

#### 2. Key Regulatory Framework & Directives

| Authority | Regulatory Position & Directive | Practical Buyer Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** | **Circular DBOD.BP.BC.No. 51/2013-14 & NHB Directives**: Banned upfront loan disbursements in tripartite subvention agreements. Banks are strictly mandated to release funds **only in tranches tied to physical site milestones**. | If a developer offers a bank loan where they service your interest during construction, it violates central banking directives. |
| **UP RERA Position (2026)** | UP RERA does **not** recognize informal tripartite EMI guarantees. Section 4(2)(l)(D) mandates that 70% of buyer collections must sit in a designated **RERA Escrow Account** disbursed strictly on architect/CA progress certifications. | If the builder defaults on promised EMIs, **the bank will legally hold YOU (the homebuyer) liable**, initiating SARFAESI recovery and impacting your CIBIL score. |
| **Supreme Court Precedents** | Multiple consumer & RERA benches have ruled that banks cannot coerce buyers for EMIs when builders defaulted on subvention commitments, but legal defense costs and credit score damage remain high. | High legal friction if entering tripartite subvention contracts. |

#### 3. Subvention vs. Legal Construction-Linked Alternatives

| Feature | Bank-Financed Subvention (Banned/High Risk) | Builder Possession-Linked (20:80 PLP - Legal) | Construction-Linked Plan (CLP 10:90 - Safest) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | Tripartite (Buyer - Builder - Bank) | Direct Bilateral (Buyer - Builder) | Milestone-governed via Escrow |
| **Loan Activation** | Sanctioned & disbursed upfront | No loan until possession inspection | Disbursed floor-by-floor as built |
| **EMI Responsibility** | Builder promises to pay (Buyer liable on default) | **Zero EMI** (No loan exists until handover) | Pre-EMI only on disbursed portion |
| **RERA & RBI Standing** | **Disallowed** by RBI/NHB | **Fully Legal** under UP RERA | **Gold Standard** recommended by UP RERA |
| **Risk Exposure** | **Extreme**: Insolvency or delay leaves buyer with EMIs | **Low**: Capital risk capped to initial 20% down payment | **Lowest**: Total financial leverage stays with buyer |

#### 4. RealtyPals Advisory Checklist Before Signing
1. **Never sign an upfront bank disbursement mandate**: Never allow a lender to disburse loan funds ahead of certified physical slab construction.
2. **Demand Builder PLP without Loan**: If you want a 20:80 or 10:90 structure, insist on a **Builder-Direct PLP agreement** recorded in your registered BBA (Builder Buyer Agreement) with zero bank loan involvement until the Occupancy Certificate (OC).
3. **Verify Escrow Deposit**: Confirm that your 20% booking payment is routed directly to the project's **UP RERA Designated Escrow Account**, not a developer general operations account.
