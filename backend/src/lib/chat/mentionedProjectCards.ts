/**
 * Cards for the projects an open answer actually named.
 *
 * The OPEN lane answers general questions from grounded prose and, by design,
 * emitted no cards. That is right for "who founded Elite Group" and wrong for
 * "what are the most premium gated communities in Sector 78" — a question the
 * classifier reads as open, but whose answer names four real projects we hold.
 * The buyer got prose with inline links and no way to compare, save or open
 * anything, and had to re-ask in listing phrasing to get cards.
 *
 * The lane already resolves those projects against the database to build the
 * inline links, so the ids are in hand. This turns them into cards.
 *
 * Two properties make it safe under the "answer only what was asked" rule:
 *
 *   - The set is exactly what the answer named. Nothing is added, no sector is
 *     back-filled, no "similar projects" are appended. If the answer named one
 *     project, one card appears.
 *   - Names are matched against Project rows, so a name the model invented
 *     resolves to nothing and produces no card.
