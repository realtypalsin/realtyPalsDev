/**
 * Context and contract for the chat topic handlers.
 *
 * chat-router.ts grew a single ~3,900-line POST handler containing fourteen
 * hardcoded topic branches, each doing its own database work, writing its own
 * response and returning early before the generic gateway path below them ever
 * ran. That shape is why every fabrication bug found in this codebase lived in
 * one file: fourteen independent places to get honesty right is fourteen places
 * to get it wrong, and they drifted — one of them still instructed buyers to
 * visit up-rera.in, which the system prompt explicitly forbids.
 *
 * Extracting them behind this contract does three things:
 *   - each topic becomes a file small enough to review and test on its own
 *   - the context is an explicit type, so a handler cannot silently depend on
 *     some incidental local variable — the compiler is the verifier
 *   - a handler can be deleted once the generic path answers its topic as well,
 *     one at a time, with a test per removal
